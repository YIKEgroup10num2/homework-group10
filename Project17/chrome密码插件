Get the code
First, configure Git:

$ git config --global user.name "My Name"
$ git config --global user.email "my-name@chromium.org"
$ git config --global core.autocrlf false
$ git config --global core.filemode false
$ git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always
Create a chromium directory for the checkout and change to it. You can call this whatever you like and put it wherever you like, as long as the full path has no spaces. However there are some performance benefits for Googlers in placing the directory under C:\src\ (See Why is my build slow?).

$ mkdir chromium && cd chromium
Run the fetch tool from depot_tools to check out the code and its dependencies.

$ fetch chromium
If you don't want the full repo history, you can save a lot of time by adding the --no-history flag to fetch.

Expect the command to take over an hour on even a fast connection, and many hours on slower ones. You should configure your PC so that it doesn't sleep or hibernate during the fetch or else errors may occur. If errors occur while fetching sub-repos then you can start over, or you may be able to correct them by going to the chromium/src directory and running this command:

$ gclient sync
When fetch completes, it will have created a hidden .gclient file and a directory called src in the working directory. The remaining instructions assume you have switched to the src directory:

$ cd src
Optional: You can also install API keys if you want your build to talk to some Google services, but this is not necessary for most development and testing purposes.
